## Introduction

This project aims to cluster Netflix TV shows and movies based on various attributes such as genres, ratings, and other metadata. By grouping similar content together, we can enhance content discovery and provide better recommendations to users.

## Project Overview

The primary goals of this project are:
- To preprocess and clean the Netflix dataset.
- To implement various clustering algorithms.
- To analyze and visualize the clustering results.
- To derive meaningful insights that can improve content recommendation.

## Data Collection

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle's Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows). It includes details such as titles, genres, directors, cast, release year, ratings, and more.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Normalizing numerical features.
- Creating a feature matrix for clustering.

## Clustering Techniques

We implemented and compared the following clustering techniques:
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **DBSCAN**

## Results and Analysis

The clustering results are analyzed using various metrics and visualizations:
- Elbow method and silhouette score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Visualization of clusters using PCA and t-SNE.
- Interpretation of clusters to identify common themes and patterns.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Plotly**

## Future Work

Potential future improvements include:
- Incorporating more advanced NLP techniques for better genre and plot analysis.
- Exploring deep learning-based clustering methods.
- Enhancing the recommendation system by integrating user behavior data.
